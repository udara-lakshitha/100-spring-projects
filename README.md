# üöÄ 100 Spring Boot Projects: A Mastery Journey üöÄ

Welcome! This repository chronicles my ambitious journey to achieve comprehensive mastery of the Spring Boot ecosystem by building **100 distinct, progressively complex projects**.

## üå± The Goal

The objective is not just to write code, but to deeply understand the **"why"** behind the features and patterns used in modern Java backend development with Spring. Each project aims to tackle specific concepts, moving from foundational principles to advanced, real-world application scenarios including microservices, cloud-native patterns, reactive programming, messaging, AI integration, and more.

## ‚ú® Core Principles & Constraints

Every project within this repository adheres to the following principles:

1.  **üéØ Focused Learning:** Each project targets specific Spring Boot features or related technologies.
2.  **üìö Thorough Documentation:** Every project (`project-NNN-name/`) includes a detailed `README.md` explaining its purpose, key concepts, setup, testing strategy, API (if applicable), and deployment notes.
3.  **üß™ Mandatory Testing:** Unit and Integration tests are integral parts of each project, ensuring correctness and demonstrating testing best practices (JUnit 5, Mockito, Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers).
4.  **üí∞ Free & Open Technologies:** All projects are built using freely available software (Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Minikube, etc.) and leverage free tiers of cloud services where applicable for deployment examples.
5.  **üåê Publicly Available:** All code and documentation are hosted here on GitHub for reference and tracking progress.
6.  **üè¢ Real-World Relevance:** Projects aim to simulate real-world problems and solutions, increasing in complexity towards industry-standard patterns.
7.  ** SINGLE REPOSITORY: ** All 100 projects will reside in this single repository for centralized management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technology Stack (Across Projects)

While individual projects might use specific additions, the core stack includes:

*   **Language:** Java (17+)
*   **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.x
*   **Core Spring Modules:** Spring Core (IoC/DI), Spring Web (MVC/WebFlux), Spring Data (JPA, Mongo, Redis, R2DBC), Spring Security, Spring AOP, Spring Test
*   **Build Tools:** Maven / Gradle
*   **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2, MongoDB, Redis (via Free Tiers/Docker)
*   **Messaging:** Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ (via Docker/Free Tiers)
*   **Cloud/Distributed Systems:** Spring Cloud (Gateway, Config, Discovery - often via Docker Compose), Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube/Kind), Spring Cloud Function (FaaS Free Tiers)
*   **AI:** Spring AI (using local models like Ollama where possible)
*   **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ, Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers
*   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
